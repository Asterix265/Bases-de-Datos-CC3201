The primary aim of this project is to study and analyze the evolution of the sport in the NBA over time, exploring various aspects such as:

- **Offensive Surge:** We will evaluate how the points per game have changed across seasons. Has there been a surge in offense? Is there any relation to other factors?
  
- **Impact of 3-Point Shooting:** We will investigate the relationship between the increase in 3-point attempts and their effectiveness with the game's evolution and the total score per game.
